# Codecademy - Front-End Engineer Path - Challenge Project: Build your own cheatsheet

## Overview
This is my solution to the Challenge Project: Build your own cheatsheet that can be found on the [Front-End Engineer path from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/front-end-engineer)

### Requirements

1. The project should document at least one HTML or CSS topic.
2. The site should use HTML tables to display the documentation. Be sure to label the columns in the HTML.
3. The site should utilize a custom color scheme.
4. The site should use custom styles for any code such as HTML tags or CSS properties or values (like font-family). Represent code using a monospace font family and a different background color.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML
- CSS3

### What I learned
With this project, I learned how to stylize a table. At first, I wasn't sure how to approach this challenge, partly because I have not worked extensively with tables before. So this was a fun and interesting challenge.
